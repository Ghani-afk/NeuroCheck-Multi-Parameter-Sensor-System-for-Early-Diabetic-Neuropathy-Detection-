# NeuroCheck-Multi-Parameter-Sensor-System-for-Early-Diabetic-Neuropathy-Detection-
NeuroCheck is a multimodal physiological analysis platform designed to detect peripheral neuropathy through synchronized responses to calibrated vibrotactile stimuli. The system records five physiological signals simultaneously and evaluates them across multiple signal domains to generate an objective assessment of nerve function.

Overview

NeuroCheck delivers a controlled vibration stimulus and captures the body’s response using piezoelectric vibration sensing, galvanic skin response, surface EMG, pulse oximetry, and thermistor-based temperature monitoring. Each modality reflects a different physiological pathway, allowing the system to analyze sensory, motor, autonomic, perfusion, and thermoregulatory functions.

Key Features

Calibrated Vibrotactile Stimulation
Generates a consistent vibration reference for synchronized sensor response analysis.

Five-Sensor Multimodal Acquisition
Piezo (vibration), GSR (sudomotor), EMG (motor activity), PPG and HR (peripheral perfusion), and thermistor (acral temperature).

Structured Signal Pipeline
Includes filtering, normalization, artifact reduction, and precise timing alignment with the stimulus.

Multi-domain Analysis
• Time domain: amplitude behavior, latency, waveform stability
• Frequency domain: peak energy, spectral distribution
• Laplace domain: physiological stability trends
• Z domain: digital system consistency and response behavior

Neuropathy Pattern Identification
Detects sensory loss, motor weakening, autonomic impairment, perfusion irregularities, and thermoregulatory deficits.
